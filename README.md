## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for grading and testing purposes. 

1. Clone repository. Click on the clone button next to the repository (clone with SSH).
2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. After the files necessary for the react app, the file structure follows an MVC pattern with the main diretories       being `client`, `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `scripts` and the `server.js` file which connects the app to       the database and the server. 
5. The client directory holds all of the logic connecting the backend to the front.
6. Each component is defined within the `components` directory. 
7. Each of the necessary pages displayed in the browser are defined in the `pages` directory.
8. the `models` folder handles the data of the application. 
9. The logic for the google books API is held in the `controllers` directory.
10. The `routes` folder holds the logic for the routes which receives the user input, validates it and passes it through the modls.
